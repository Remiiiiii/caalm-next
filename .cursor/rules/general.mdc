- Use `pnpm add` when installing new packages.
- Use `npx shadcn add` to add new shadcn components.
- Never try to start the app itself (I have it running in a separate terminal), instead, if you need to restart the server on localhost:3000 first use the `taskkill` command and then the `pnpm run dev` command.
- Always clean up resources (event listeners, timers, subscriptions) in the cleanup function to prevent memory leaks and ensure your app performs well!
