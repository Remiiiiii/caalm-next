**[Opening - 0:00]**

Hey there! Welcome to this quick demo of the CAALM app—a modern, AI-powered platform designed for non-profit organizations to manage users, documents, and compliance with ease. I’m excited to show you around, so let’s dive in!

**[Login & Dashboard - 0:15]**

First, let’s log in. After entering your credentials, you’ll land on the dashboard. Right away, you’ll notice a clean, modern interface with a beautiful animated background and intuitive navigation.

At the top, you’ll see your name, role, and department, along with quick access icons for notifications, messages, and logout.

**[Notification Center - 0:35]**

Let’s check out notifications. Click the bell icon in the header to open the Notification Center. Eventually, you’ll see all your important alerts—like expiring audits, contracts, and licenses—displayed in a searchable, paginated table. You can mark notifications as read, delete them, or perform bulk actions. Next week I will be implementing a badge on the bell icon to provide updates in real time, so you never miss anything urgent.

**[User Management - 1:00]**

Next, let’s head to User Management. Here, you can view all users in a stylish, glassmorphism-themed card. There’s a search bar, filter options, and a table with checkboxes for bulk actions. You can select multiple users and delete them at once, with a confirmation dialog to prevent mistakes. Each user’s status is clearly shown with color-coded badges, and you can easily page through large user lists.

**[File Management - 1:30]**

Now, let’s look at File Management. The app automatically categorizes files—like images, documents, and more. You can see the total file size, filter by file type, and view only images if you want. The interface is fast and responsive, making it easy to find and manage your files.

**[AI-Driven Features - 2:00]**

One of CAALM’s standout features is its AI integration. The app can send smart notifications for expiring documents, helping you stay compliant and avoid surprises. There are plans for even more AI-powered tools, like document classification, semantic search, and predictive analytics, all aimed at making your workflow smarter and more efficient.

**[User Experience & Design - 2:30]**

Throughout the app, you’ll notice a mostly consistent color palette, modern UI elements, and smooth transitions. The design is not just pretty—it’s functional, with accessibility and ease of use in mind. Whether you’re an executive, manager, or HR, the experience is tailored to your needs.

**[Security & Permissions - 3:00]**

Security is a top priority. The app uses robust authentication and fine-grained permissions, so only authorized users can access sensitive data. You can rest assured that your organization’s information is safe.

**[Quick Recap & Closing - 3:20]**

So, to recap: Upone completion, CAALM will offer powerful user and document management, real-time notifications, bulk actions, and a beautiful, intuitive interface—all with AI-driven enhancements and strong security. It’s built to help organizations work smarter, not harder.

Thanks for watching!
