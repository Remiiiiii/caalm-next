# AI Integration Reference

The conversation focused on enhancing a Next.js-based document and user management app (CAALM) with modern UI/UX and advanced features. Key actions and discussions included:

1. **SVG & Sidebar Improvements**: The assistant helped standardize SVG icons for dashboard items and ensured sidebar links (like "Uploads" and "Images") correctly routed to dynamic pages that display all relevant files.

2. **Dynamic File Summing**: The user wanted the total file size (in MB) to be dynamically calculated and displayed. The assistant updated the code to sum file sizes using a utility and display the formatted result.

3. **File Type Filtering**: The assistant ensured that the "Images" section only showed `.png`, `.jpg`, and `.jpeg` files, updating both the utility and the page logic to filter by extension.

4. **User Management Refactor**: The user management table and all related logic were extracted into a new `UserManagement.tsx` component. The sidebar and routing were updated so "User Management" now points to `/dashboard/user-management`.

5. **User Management UI Redesign**: The assistant provided and implemented a modern, glassmorphism-inspired card UI for user management, including a search bar, filter button, table with checkboxes, status badges, and pagination. The card and its elements were styled to match the app’s blue/teal/white theme, and the "User Management" title was given a gradient matching the hero section.

6. **Bulk Delete Functionality**: The assistant implemented multi-user selection with checkboxes and a trash icon button showing the count of selected users. Clicking the button opens a confirmation dialog listing all users to be deleted, with a confirmation step before deletion.

7. **Checkbox Customization**: The assistant customized the checkboxes to have a cyan glow (`#03AFBF`), removed the default black border, and then set the outline to `slate-700` for better theme consistency. Vertical alignment of checkboxes in the table was also fixed.

8. **Background Video Integration**: The assistant added a full-page animated video background (`wave.mp4`) to both the executive dashboard and the user management page, ensuring content remains readable above the video.

9. **Status Badge Logic**: The assistant ensured that user status (active/inactive) is reflected in the UI by mapping the `status` property from the backend to the badge color and label.

10. **Filter Icon Addition**: A filter icon from `lucide-react` was added to the left of the "Filter" button text for visual clarity.

11. **AI Integration Suggestions**: The assistant provided a comprehensive analysis of how AI could be integrated into the app, including intelligent document processing, semantic search, predictive analytics, personalized dashboards, compliance checking, automated reporting, and workflow automation. Recommendations were prioritized by impact and complexity, with references to real-world AI integration guides and tools.

Throughout, the assistant made sure to use Tailwind and the project’s custom color palette, followed the user’s preferences for official utility classes, and ensured all UI/UX changes were consistent with the app’s branding and design language.
